For the bonus part of the homework (UFO Level 2) I have created filter so that all sightings that match any of the filter input entered are returned. 
For example, if you filter on state 'ca' and shape 'sphere' then all California and all sphere sightings will be returned.

Homework instructions were unclear but I will look into returning only the sightings that meet ALL input filters.
